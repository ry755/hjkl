/// The entry point of the program. This passes the input/output file and the first 3 command line arguments from the stack (where fox32os puts them) into registers (where the Jackal calling convention expects them). The fifth parameter, the fourth command line argument, remains on the stack. Then the Main function is called, which must not return.
